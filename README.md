# Personal Reel Gallery üéûÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Personal Reel Gallery**, a Flutter-based mobile application designed to provide a user experience similar to Instagram Reels or TikTok. This app allows users to create a personal gallery of short video clips by adding them from their device. It features a vertically scrollable video feed, user authentication, and local data persistence for a seamless experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login functionality using Firebase Authentication.
- **Vertical Video Feed**: A smooth, vertically swiping reel player for an engaging viewing experience.
- **Add Videos**: Users can pick videos from their phone's gallery and add them to their personal reel feed.
- **Video Grid**: View all your added videos in a convenient grid layout for easy navigation.
- **Local Storage**: Utilizes Hive for fast and efficient local storage of video metadata and paths.
- **Persistent Data**: Likes, comments, and other video data are saved locally on the device.
- **Delete Videos**: Users can remove videos from their gallery.

## üèõÔ∏è Brief Architecture Notes

This application is built using Flutter and follows a simple yet effective architecture.

- **State Management**: The app primarily uses `StatefulWidget` and the `setState` mechanism for managing local UI state. This approach is suitable for the current scale of the application.
- **Backend & Authentication**: **Firebase Authentication** is used for handling all user-related operations like registration and login. The app features an `AuthGate` widget that acts as a listener to the user's authentication state, directing them to either the login screen or the main reels page.
- **Local Database**: **Hive** is integrated as a lightweight and fast key-value database. It is used for two main purposes:
    1.  Storing the file paths of videos that the user adds from their gallery.
    2.  Persisting metadata for each video (e.g., likes, comments) in a `VideoData` object.
- **Code Generation**: The project uses the `build_runner` package to generate adapter code for Hive (`.g.dart` files), which ensures type safety and performance.
- **Navigation**: Standard Flutter navigation (`MaterialPageRoute`, `Navigator`) is used for screen transitions.

## üîß Backend Setup (Firebase)

This project does not require a traditional mock server. Instead, it uses **Firebase** as its backend for authentication. To run the app, you need to set up your own Firebase project.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project**:
    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Click on "Add project" and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new project.

2.  **Add Flutter Apps**:
    - Inside your project, add a new **Android** app and a new **iOS** app.
    - Follow the setup instructions, including adding the package name (e.g., `com.example.reelgallry`) and downloading the configuration files (`google-services.json` for Android and `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS).

3.  **Enable Authentication**:
    - In the Firebase Console, navigate to the **Authentication** section.
    - Go to the "Sign-in method" tab and enable the **Email/Password** provider.

4.  **Configure Flutter App**:
    - The easiest way to connect your Flutter app is by using the FlutterFire CLI.
    - Install the CLI by running: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`
    - In your project's root directory, run the configure command: `flutterfire configure`
    - This command will automatically fetch your Firebase project's configuration and generate the `lib/firebase_options.dart` file. **You must replace the existing file with the one you generate.**

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 3.0.0 or higher)
- An IDE like VS Code or Android Studio
- An Android Emulator or a physical device

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Set Up Firebase**
    - Follow all the steps mentioned in the **Backend Setup** section above. This is a mandatory step.

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    - Run the following command to fetch all the required packages.
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Run Code Generator**
    - The project uses Hive, which requires generated files. Run the `build_runner` command to create them.
    ```sh
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```

5.  **Run the App**
    - You're all set! Run the app on your connected device or emulator.
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

Enjoy your personal reel gallery! üéâ
